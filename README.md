## Application Structure
- server.js - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also inncludes the routes we'll be using in the application.
- config/ - This folder contains configuration for central location environment variables and other configurations.
- routes/ - This folder contains the route definitions (answer, question etc. ) for our API.
- models/ - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models (User, Question).
- controllers/ - This folder contains controllers for our API.
- public/ - This folder contains static files for our API.
- middlewares/ - This folder contains middlewares for our API.
- helpers/ - This folder contains helper functions for adapting 3rd party libraries for our API.
- dummy/ - This folder contains dummy data created by dummy-generator.js file for our database.

## Error Handling
In middlewares/errors/errorHandler.js, we define a error-handling middleware for handling Mongoose's errors and our own errors.

## Authentication
Requests are authenticated using the Authorization header and value Bearer: {{token}}. with a valid JWT.

We define express middlewares in middlewares/authorization/auth.js that can be used to authenticate requests. The required middlewares returns 401 or 403.
